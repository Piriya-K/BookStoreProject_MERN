First project using REACT, Node.JS, Express.JS, MongoDB, PostMan and MonGoose.

This is a follow-along project. Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-42K44A1oMA

Still haven't yet mastered all these technologies, but starting to get the sense of them.

The project allows users to add, edit, update, and delete a book on the store's webpage.

Core concepts to look more into
1. states
2. components
3. routes and router using Express.JS

If looking to fork and run the project with your own MongoDB database, please and the database URI in the "config.js" file. Simply rename the "config_sample.js" to "config.js" accordingly.
